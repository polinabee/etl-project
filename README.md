# etl-project
Basic ETL project from class.
The goal was to create a pipeline that re-structures data from a sql dump file into a star schema that optimizes ease and speed of queries run by a hypothetical analyst. The resulting queries are shown in the queries.sql file. The project uses a docker image running PostgreSQL on a public EC2 instance.
